function [m] = inversescanner(M,N,x,y,theta,meas_phi,meas_r,rmax,alpha,beta,p_occ,p_free)
% Calculates the inverse measurement model for a laser scanner based on
% model in Probabilistic Robotics - note: slow but easy to understand
% Identifies three regions, the first where no new information is
% available, the second where objects are likely to exist and the third
% where objects are unlikely to exist.  Returns an occupancy grid map of
% size MXN with p(occupied|measurements) for each cell.
% M, N - size of occupancy grid map (MXN)
% x,y,theta - position of robot in map ( assumes 1 unit grid cells)

% TODO: Modify to take in grid cell size.

% Initialize measurement model
m = 0.5*ones(M, N);
