                r_m, r_max, alpha, beta, p_occ, p_free)
% Calculates the inverse measurement model for a laser scanner based on
% model in Probabilistic Robotics. The function only generates a specified 
% window of cells. Note: slow but easy to understand. Identifies three 
% regions, the first where no new information is available, the second 
% where objects are likely to exist and the third where objects are 
% unlikely to exist. Returns an occupancy grid map of size M x N with 
% p(occupied|measurements) for each cell.
%
% Input:
%   M = Height of window
%   N = Width of window
%   [x] = Robot state vector [x position; y position; heading]
%   [win_pos] = position of the robot relative to the window frame
%   [phi_m] = Array of measurement angles relative to robot
%   [r_m] = Array of (r)ange (m)easurements
%   r_max = Max range of laser
%   alpha = Width of an obstacle (Distance about measurement to fill in)
%   beta = Width of a beam (Angle beyond which to exclude) 
%   p_occ = Probability of an occupied cell
%   p_free = Probability of an unoccupied cell
% Output:
% 	[imml] = Log odds of the (i)nverse (m)easurement (m)odel

% Bound the update window within the map dimensions
